# Interactive-Survey-Dashboard-for-Data-Professionals
This project involved designing and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights from a global survey of over 600 data professionals. 
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as average salary by job role and country, preferred programming languages, work-life balance satisfaction, and the perceived difficulty of breaking into the data field.

The dashboard features:

Dynamic visuals comparing salaries across job roles like Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, and Architects

Popular programming languages among respondents, with Python leading the list

Country-wise salary distribution with notable differences across regions

Work-life balance and salary satisfaction ratings on a 10-point scale

Respondents' experiences breaking into the data industry, showing that nearly 43% found it difficult

The goal of the project was to make survey results easily understandable, interactive, and actionable for stakeholders exploring career trends in the data industry.
